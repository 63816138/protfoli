      <br /><br />
      Hello, I'm Mugesh, a Computer Science student at Mahendra Engineering
      College with a passion for web development. I aspire to become a
      full-stack developer, and I'm dedicated to mastering both front-end and
      back-end technologies. My journey began with a fascination for how
      websites work, and I've since gained proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
      Node.js, Express, MySQL, and MongoDB. I'm constantly learning and excited
      to contribute to innovative projects. Let's create something amazing
      together!
